# For the special case when your design matrix is just a group indicator (that is, you have two groups of individuals), you can use the function thin_2group(). Letâ€™s generate data from the two-group model where 90% of genes are null and the non-null effects are gamma-distributed.

# rgamma used this time!
thout <- thin_2group(mat = submat, 
                     prop_null     = 0.9, 
                     signal_fun    = stats::rgamma,
                     signal_params = list(shape = 1, rate = 1))

# We can again verify that we thinned appropriately using the voom-limma pipeline:

new_design <- cbind(thout$design_obs, thout$designmat)
# new_design
#>      (Intercept) P1
#> [1,]           1  0
#> [2,]           1  0
#> [3,]           1  0
#> [4,]           1  1
#> [5,]           1  1
#> [6,]           1  1

vout <- limma::voom(counts = thout$mat, design = new_design)
lout <- limma::lmFit(vout)
coefhat <- coef(lout)[, 2, drop = FALSE]
And we can plot the results
