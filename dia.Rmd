<!-- in many ways. a crap example
I didn't know the carat gave the size of the diamond itself.
But that's my fault.
Why we should be interested by the very large number of smaller diamonds
also seems obscure. The resulting graph is perplexing
it looks like a renegade gamma function -->

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```
