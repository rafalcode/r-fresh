df <- read.table("stovtime.txt", header=T)

# As I get it from the docs ggpaired only offers the option to set the color for all lines as an argument. But if you want to highlight just some IDs you could do so using a geom_line to which you pass a subsetted dataframe:

CairoPNG("ggp0.png", 800, 800)
ggp <- ggpaired(df, cond1 = "Time1", cond2 = "Time2", line.color = "gray",
  fill = "condition", palette = "jco", xlab = "Sample Timepoint", ylab = "OD") +
  geom_line(data = ~subset(., ID %in% c("A", "B")), aes(group = id), color = "red") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "Black", size = 14, face = "bold.italic"))
show(ggp)
dev.off()
